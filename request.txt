Hi,

I was hoping you could help me out with something.  I maintain an open source project hosted on code.google.com.
The name of the project is ... Morphia (https://code.google.com/p/morphia/).  I am planning to move the project 
to github soon, and wanted to put the  project under a Morphia user, since I may not always be the maintainer 
of this project.  

I noticed that you're not so active on github, and so I wonder if you would consider giving up the name and letting me 
take it over as the home for the Morphia project.  

Thanks,
Jeff Yemin
